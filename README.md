## Game Overview
At its core, our game is a platformer with elements of combat and exploration. The theme revolves around the quest to recover a magical helmet, now inhabited by evil spirits. The path to the golem's lair is blocked by enemies, and you must find 7 keys to reach the lair, defeat the golem, and retrieve the helmet.

## Development Journey
We started with no prior knowledge of pygame but were determined to create a platformer. After learning the basics from a tutorial, we implemented additional features using our own logic. These include a combat system, pushable blocks, ladders, and chests with collectible keys.

### Combat System
The combat system involves enemies attacking when the player is within their radius. Implementing this required careful management of player and enemy states using booleans. The boss can only be attacked during its idle state.

### Pushable Blocks
Pushable blocks can be stood upon or pushed horizontally by the player. Collision logic determines the player's interaction with the blocks. If a block collides with a wall, it stops moving.

### Ladders
Players can climb up and down ladders, with gravity disabled while grabbing a ladder. The onrope boolean tracks whether the player is on a ladder.
